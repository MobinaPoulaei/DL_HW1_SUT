        "1. **Computing the Loss and its Derivatives:**  \n",
        "   We evaluate the loss function for the current parameters, compute the gradient, and optionally calculate the Hessian if using a second-order method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Applying the Update Rule:**  \n",
        "   Based on the computed derivatives, we update the parameters using the specific logic of our chosen optimization method (e.g., adjusting the parameters using SGD, Adam, or Newton's method).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Maintaining State:**  \n",
        "   For methods that require momentum or other historical data, we update and maintain a state dictionary that carries this information from one iteration to the next.\n",

        "By following these steps, we can iteratively update the parameters to minimize the loss function and analyze the optimization trajectory. Let's move on to see this process in action.\n",

        "# General Optimization Function Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "The `optimize` function provides a unified framework for iterative optimization methods. Whether using first-order (gradient-based) or second-order (Hessian-based) methods, the overall process remains similar: we start with an initial guess for the parameters and then iteratively update these parameters in order to minimize a given loss function.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization:**\n",
        "   - **Parameters:**  \n",
        "     The function receives an initial parameter tensor (`initial_params`). This tensor is cloned and set to require gradients so that we can compute derivatives with respect to it.\n",
        "   - **State Storage:**  \n",
        "     An empty dictionary `state` is initialized to store any additional information required by the update method (e.g., momentum for Adam, or curvature approximations for second-order methods).\n",
        "   - **Path Recording:**  \n",
        "     The initial parameters are stored in a list called `path`. This list will hold the parameter values after each iteration, allowing us to visualize the optimization trajectory later.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Iterative Update Process:**\n",
        "   - For each epoch (i.e., optimization step), the following steps occur:\n",
        "     1. **Loss Evaluation:**  \n",
        "        The loss function `loss_func` is evaluated at the current parameter values to determine how well the current parameters perform.\n",
        "     2. **Gradient Computation:**  \n",
        "        The gradient (first derivative) of the loss with respect to the parameters is computed using `loss.backward()`.  \n",
        "        - For **first-order methods**, only the gradient is used.\n",
        "        - For **second-order methods**, additional curvature information is needed.\n",
        "     3. **Hessian Computation (Optional):**  \n",
        "        If the `second_order` flag is set to `True`, the Hessian (matrix of second derivatives) is computed using PyTorch's `torch.autograd.functional.hessian`.  \n",
        "        This Hessian provides insight into the curvature of the loss surface and is useful for methods like Newton's method.\n",
        "     4. **Parameter Update:**  \n",
        "        The update function `update_func` is then called:\n",
        "        - For **first-order methods** (e.g., SGD, Adam):  \n",

        "        This function returns updated parameter values and an updated state.\n",

        "## Common Underlying Principles\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Unified Structure:**  \n",
        "  All optimization methods follow a similar iterative procedure: compute the loss, compute the gradient (and optionally the Hessian), update the parameters, and record the progress.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **First-Order vs. Second-Order Methods:**  \n",

        "    $$ w_{t+1} = w_t - \\left( H(w_t) + \\epsilon I \\right)^{-1} \\nabla f(w_t) $$\n",
        "  The `second_order` flag in our function determines whether the Hessian is computed and passed to the update function.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **State Management:**  \n",
        "  Many advanced optimizers (like Adam, RMSprop, or L-BFGS) maintain a state that includes historical information (e.g., moving averages of gradients, momentum, or curvature approximations). This state is updated at each iteration and passed to the update function to help guide the parameter updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the `optimize` function abstracts the common iterative process of optimization, allowing us to plug in different update functions (each corresponding to a different optimization method) and compare their performance on the same problem.

        "\n",
        "A higher learning rate (like 0.1, 0.01) tends to cause instability, overshooting, or oscillations, especially in functions with sharp gradients or complex landscapes like Rosenbrock, Beale, and Ill-conditioned convex. Some functions, such as Rastrigin, show fluctuations, indicating that the step size is too large to settle into a minimum. In other cases, like Schwefel, Ackley, and Eggholder, the optimizer gets trapped in local minima, suggesting that high LR jumps too aggressively and fails to explore better solutions.\n",

        "A lower learning rate (0.001, 0.0001) leads to extremely slow convergence. Many functions, such as Rastrigin, Schwefel, and Ackley, result in the optimizer getting stuck near the initial point, meaning the step size is too small to make meaningful progress. However, in well-conditioned convex landscapes, such as Beale and Ill-conditioned convex, this small LR allows steady progress and reaches the global minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results suggest that a moderate learning rate (e.g., 0.01 or 0.001) might provide a balance between speed and stability. A too-high LR risks instability, while a too-low LR may cause stagnation.\n",

        "  - **Fluctuations in rugged landscapes**: In highly non-convex functions like Rastrigin, the optimizer fluctuated, likely bouncing between local minima without settling.\n",

        "  - **Improved stability for smooth functions**: In convex landscapes (2D Beale, 2D Ill-conditioned convex), the optimizer successfully reached the global minimum without overshooting.\n",
        "  - **Local minima trapping**: For rugged functions like Ackley and Eggholder, the small LR prevented the optimizer from escaping poor local solutions.\n",

        "  - Higher LRs accelerate learning but at the cost of stability, often leading to oscillations or divergence.\n",

        "  - Non-convex functions (e.g., Rastrigin, Eggholder, Ackley) are highly sensitive to LR. A high LR causes erratic behavior, while a low LR leads to stagnation.\n",
        "  - Smooth convex functions (e.g., Beale, Ill-conditioned convex) benefit from a lower LR, as slow and steady updates help reach the global minimum.\n",

If convergence is too slow, slightly increase **lr** or **momentum**, but be cautious of overshooting. For highly sensitive functions prone to instability, reduce **lr** while keeping **momentum at 0.9** to maintain steady progress. If loss curves oscillate, momentum is likely too high and should be lowered. Conversely, if the optimizer gets stuck in local minima, increasing momentum can help escape. Always monitor the loss curve trends and fine-tune parameters based on stability and convergence speed.\n",
